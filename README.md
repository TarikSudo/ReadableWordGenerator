# ReadableWordGenerator
## Overview
ReadableWordGenerator is a simple Python script designed to generate pronounceable words of customizable length. Employing combinations of English vowels and consonants, it follows structured patterns like consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel (CVCV) and vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant (VCVC). This feature makes it highly suitable for creating memorable, easy-to-pronounce words for a variety of applications.

## Key Features
**Customizable Word Length**: Users have the flexibility to specify the desired length of the words, allowing the generation of words from short to relatively longer sequences, tailored to specific needs.

**Pattern-Based Generation**: Leverages vowel and consonant patterns to ensure the produced words are pronounceable and follow a logical linguistic structure.

**Output in CSV Format**: The generated words are conveniently saved in a CSV file, facilitating easy export and integration with other tools or datasets.

## Usage
To use ReadableWordGenerator, simply set the desired word length as a parameter. The script will then generate a list of words based on the specified length and save them in a CSV file for easy access and manipulation.
